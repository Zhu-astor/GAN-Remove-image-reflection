## Dataset
The file is too big . I can't put on my github . You can go to https://sir2data.github.io/ to download SIR dataset. My Classify code is Classification_image.py and Data_preprocess.py. You can refer to build the dataset for two class.

> Class1 : Reflection Class2 : NonReflection


## Model : Pix2pix
<<<<<<< HEAD
Refer to https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN/tree/master/pix2pix . I changed the datasets and some code.
Basically i used Pix2pix model to run this mission.I will try more model for comparing accuracy later.
